# Finished the Flexbox video series by Wes Bos 
# (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vj7NZ6FiQvo&list=PLu8EoSxDXHP7xj_y6NIAhy0wuCd4uVdid)

* I took the App Layout from the final video and added my custom styling (i.e changed fonts, colors...)
* In this repo you will also see the Gulp files from the previous video in the series.
